# Unified Dotfile Directory

After months of maintaining three different Arch Linux rices across three different computers, I have realized that it would probably be worth it to put all of my dotfles in one nice folder with some scripts to set things up for me.

# TO-DO
* [ ] Add i3 config
* [ ] Optimize dotfiles for use across all devices
    * [ ] vimrc
    * [ ] bashrc
    * [ ] zshrc
* [ ] Finally pick a definitive colorscheme
* [ ] Create git repo
