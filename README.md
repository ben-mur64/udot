# Unified Dotfile Directory

After months of maintaining three different Arch Linux rices across three different computers, I have realized that it would probably be worth it to put all of my dotfiles in one nice folder with some scripts to set things up for me.

## Installation

* Run ```git submodule init ``` and ```git submodule update``` in the vim bundle folder before installing.

## Branches

Three different branches are available for use. The master branch is for my laptop, and the desktop and server branches are what you would imagine.
